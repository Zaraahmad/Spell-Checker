I started my schooling as the majority did in my area, at the local primarry school. I then went to the local secondarry school and recieved grades in English, Maths, Phisics, Biology, Geography, Art, Graphical Comunication and Philosophy of Religeon. I'll not bore you with the 'A' levels and above. Notice the ambigous English qualification above. It was, in truth, a cource dedicated to reading "Lord of the flies" and other gems, and a weak atempt at getting us to commprehend them. Luckilly my middle-class upbringing gave me a head start as I was already aquainted with that sort of langauge these books used (and not just the Peter and Jane books) and had read simillar books before. I will never be able to put that paticular course down as much as I desire to because, for all its faults, it introduced me to Steinbeck, Malkovich and the wonders of Lenny, mice and pockets. My education never included one iota of grammar. Lynn Truss points out in "Eats, shoots and leaves" that many people were excused from the rigours of learning English grammar during their schooling over the last 30 or so years because the majority or decision-makers decided one day that it might hinder imagination and expresion (so what, I ask, happened to all those expresive and imaginative people before the ruling?).

The blue wale is the bigest animal on earth some are as long as 100 foots and weighing 300,000 pounds? In the late 1800s and early 1900s these gentle jiants were hunted almost to extinction because humans wanted their bluber to make oil fuel soap and candles. their baleen was used to make brushes and corsets. the blue wale population is now only one percent of itÂ’s original size.
